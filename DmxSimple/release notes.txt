v2.2:
  DmxSimple.usePin() function added. Output pin can be changed at will.
  Timing loops improved to support more clock frequencies.

v2.1:
  Release notes file added. (For older revisions, see SVN log on Google Code)
  Interrupts are reenabled even during the routine.
  Therefore, interrupt heavy tasks such as receiving at 115200 baud are now possible without losing data.
